# profito
While making a buying decision, people generally get their input from various resources like traditional advertisements, online marketing and retail stores but the most powerful source of influence comes from the buyer's family and peer groups.
**profito** is a web app which deals with the above issue by targetting social influencers from social networking sites like Facebook and LinkedIn. Users select a particular post in the profito site related to their area of expertise to post on a social networking site and are rewarded according to the number of likes recieved.
profito deals with utilizing the power of small scale social influencers to increase the sales by using a bottom up rather than top down approach. The transactions are commited using the **blockchain technology** for the purpose of fast and secure transfers.
